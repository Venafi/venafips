- Add `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Revoke`
- Improve performance with `Get-VdcAttribute`, [#362](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/362).  Note, TypeName, GUID, and Name properties have been removed from the output; Path is still there.
- Fix GUIDs not converting to Name with `Get-VdcAttribute`
- Fix `Add-VdcAdaptableHash` not returning if old and new are the same
