On Windows, Windows PowerShell will already be installed, but is recommended to install the latest version of cross-platform PowerShell.  For Linux or macOS, you will need to install PowerShell; follow those links for guidance.  Once PowerShell is installed, start a PowerShell prompt and execute <code>Install-Module -Name VenafiPS</code> which will install from the gallery.</p> <p> If using an older operating system, eg. Windows Server 2016, and you receive errors downloading/installing nuget when attempting to install VenafiPS, your SSL/TLS version is most likely at the default and will not work.

You can also search from the root folder, \\ved.</p> <p>To find a certificate object, not retrieve an actual certificate, use: <pre><code>$cert = Find-VdcCertificate -First 1\n</code></pre></p> <p>Check out the parameters for <code>Find-VdcCertificate</code> as there's an extensive list to search on.</p> <p>Now you can take that certificate object and find all log entries associated with it:</p> <pre><code>$cert | Read-VdcLog\n</code></pre> <p>To perform many of the core certificate actions, we will use <code>Invoke-VdcCertificateAction</code>.  For example, to create a new session and renew a certificate, use the following:</p> <pre><code>New-VenafiSession -Server 'venafi.mycompany.com' -Credential $cred -ClientId 'MyApp' -Scope @{'certificate'='manage'}\nInvoke-VdcCertificateAction -CertificateId '\\VED\\Policy\\My folder\\app.mycompany.com' -Renew\n</code></pre> <p>You can also find and perform an action on mutliple objects.

This can be helpful to determine the difference between what different users can access or perhaps compare folder structures across environments.  The below will compare the objects one user can see vs. another.</p> <pre><code># assume you've created 1 session already as shown above...\n\n$user2Cred = Get-Credential # specify credentials for a different/limited user\n\n# get a session as user2 and save the session in a variable\n$user2Session = New-VenafiSession -ServerUrl 'https://venafi.mycompany.com' -Credential $user2Cred -PassThru\n\n# get all objects in the Policy folder for the first user\n$all = Find-VdcObject -Path '\\ved\\policy' -Recursive\n\n# get all objects in the Policy folder for user2\n$all2 = Find-VdcObject -Path '\\ved\\policy' -Recursive -VenafiSession $user2Session\n\nCompare-Object -ReferenceObject $all -DifferenceObject $all2 -Property Path\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#saas-examples","title":"SaaS Examples","text":"<p>Most of the same functionality from the above examples exist for SaaS as well.

This can be used to store your access tokens, refresh tokens, or vaas key.  To use this feature, a vault will need to be created.  You can use SecretStore provided by the PowerShell team or any other vault type.  All of this functionality has been added to <code>New-VenafiSession</code>.</p> <p>To prepare your environment, execute the following:</p> <ul> <li><code>Install-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement</code></li> <li><code>Install-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore</code> or whichever vault you would like to use</li> <li><code>Register-SecretVault -Name VenafiPS -ModuleName Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore</code>.

This is required for automation purposes.  If using a different vault type, ensure you turn off any features which inhibit automation.</li> <li>Check out the help for <code>New-VenafiSession</code> for the many ways you can store and retrieve secrets from the vault, but the easiest way to get started is:</li> <li><code>New-VenafiSession -Server cmsh.company.com -Credential $myCred -ClientId MyApp -Scope $scope -VaultRefreshTokenName mytoken</code>.  This will create a new token based session and store the refresh token in the vault.  The server and clientid will be stored with the refresh token as metadata.  Scope does not need to be stored as it is inherent in the token.</li> <li>To create a new session going forward, <code>New-VenafiSession -VaultRefreshTokenName mytoken</code>.  This will retrieve the refresh token and associated metadata from the vault, retrieve a new access token based on that refresh token and create a new session.</li> </ul> <p>Note, extension vaults are registered to the current logged in user context, and will be available only to that user (unless also registered to other users).</p>"},{"location":"#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Please feel free to log an issue for any new features you would like, bugs you come across, or just simply a question.

All functions have been renamed to prefix with <code>-Vdc</code> (Venafi Datacenter) or <code>-Vc</code> (Venafi Cloud).  Combined platform functions, those prefixed with <code>-Venafi</code>, have all been updated to dedicated platform functions.  The desire to add additional functionality for each platform and reduce parameter set complexity drove this decision.  The only exception to this rule are the functions related to the session.  Aliases have been added where applicable.</li> <li>VenafiPS is now signed.  <code>Test-ModuleHash</code> has been deprecated.</li> <li>VenafiSession is stored for nested operations each time a function is called directly.  This has 2 main benefits:</li> <li>Performance enhancement bypassing <code>Test-VenafiSession</code> in nested functions</li> <li>No longer need to pass VenafiSession to each function when sending function output down the pipeline</li> <li>Parallel functionality added for many functions, notably export and import certificates.  Ensure you are using PowerShell v7!</li> <li>Add Certificate, Key, and Chain PEM to <code>Export-VdcCertificate</code> and <code>Export-VcCertificate</code> Base64 output</li> <li>For PSCredential objects which only required a password and not username, add the ability to provide either a password String, SecureString, or PSCredential.</li> <li><code>Find-VaasObject</code> has been replaced with dedicated functions <code>Find-VcCertificateRequest</code>, <code>Find-VcLog</code>, <code>Find-VcMachine</code>, and <code>Find-VcMachineIdentity</code>.
